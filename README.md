# Po√©me  
Serverless function demo  

## Concepts
- Weighted random responses
- accept a header for strict mode  
    - strict mode enabled: e.g. keys with no value will throw error
    - strict mode disabled: rules are lax... e.g. keys with no value will be ignored
- if more than n responses are returned, show message.
